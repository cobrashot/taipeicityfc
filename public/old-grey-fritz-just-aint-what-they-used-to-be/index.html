      <p>Time: 5pm, March 13th, 2011 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie On a hot, dry Saturday afternoon, City gathered a squad of twelve to take on the once mighty Fritz. In previous seasons, facing Fritz with such a small squad would have been dicing with ignominious defeat, but Fritz are not what they were. (It seems like they&rsquo;ve gone downhill a lot since last season, never mind from when they were at their peak.) <a href="http://taipeifc.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3715-web.jpg"><img src="http://taipeifc.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/img_3715-web.jpg" alt="" title="IMG_3715 web"></a> The pattern of the game was established quite early. City applied pressure high up the field, Fritz tried to clear or play themselves out of trouble but couldn&rsquo;t and City invariably got back possession. The game wasn&rsquo;t ten minutes old when Alex Ramirez struck on the edge of the box. With City dominating possession and Fritz making mistakes, City were forcing corners and looking to build on their lead. Next, Tom Clarke spotted a high ball and leapt clear of the Fritz keeper to glance a great header into the corner of the net. 2-0. After this, yet more chances came City&rsquo;s way. However, owing to some good goalkeeping mostly, City failed to extend their lead. At the half-time team talk, Dan put it well: with the City forward line and midfield applying enough pressure, Fritz were reduced to launching long balls for their forwards but the city defence were winning everything in the air. At the restart, Fritz briefly looked liked threatening, but very soon Dan Calvert had made it 3-0 from a low cross by Ramirez. After this, Fritz let themselves go. Their one dangerous forward, no.10, got himself sent off for a kick at Ramirez. Then, the fight went from the match and City were able to keep the ball at leisure. The last goal from City was from Lionel Gonzalez - his debut goal - a clinical finish from a narrow angle. Bualien awaits now and surely they will give City a much tougher match than Fritz did.</p>
