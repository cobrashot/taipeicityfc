Weather: sunny and breezy with a little wind Field: hard and dry

Taipei City came out strong against the boys over at Rogue FC, scoring a goal in the first 4 minutes of the game. Steve crossed to Dan for the easy put away, 1-0.

Moments later another goal was in the back of the net, again from Steve crossing to Mr. Calvert again, 2-0.

Later in the half Matt Swift from Rogue scored an own goal, 3-0.

Then Paco scored a nice header that lofted in from the left side of the field, 4-0.

Then another goal from Dan before just halftime, 5-0.

Halftime water break. Michael Christie replaced Spencer in goal...clean sheet for both keepers.

The 2nd half saw 3 more goals, 2 solid finishes by Gustavo and 1 more by Dan.

All in all, it wasn't a very challenging game for Taipei City but still a pleasant way to spend Sunday morning.

Final score: Taipei City 8, Rogue FC 0.
