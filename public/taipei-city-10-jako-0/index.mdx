A thorough dusting of Jako on a wet Wednesday night.

Here were the goals:

Sean Dan Alex R. Alex R.

\- 4-0 halftime -

Dawda Alex R. Dawda Tim Tim Alex R.

\- 10-0 final -

Congrats to Alex Ramirez for scoring 4 goals in a single game...a hat-and-a-half trick or something like that.

Close to something like this:

_On 3 December 2008 Carlos Tevez of Manchester United scored a 'grand slam' against Blackburn Rovers. This consisted of a header, penalty kick (right footed), left foot and right foot._

Anyway, all the scoring meant the game was pretty uneventful for the defense. In the first half a Jako forward cracked a powerful shot that bounced off the bottom of the crossbar but was gracefully saved by Matt Wharton.

In the 2nd half Ibu got a little bored as keeper and baited a Jako forward with a drop-kick gift. He tried to lob our tall Gambian friend but missed the goal by a mile.
