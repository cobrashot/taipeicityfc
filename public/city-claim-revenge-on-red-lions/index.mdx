Match Report by Michael Christie

Location: Bai Ling B (the crappy pitch) Conditions: Fair to firm Referee: Wearing sunglasses before the game

Report: Starting in a 3-5-2 formation, Taipei City took the game to the Red Lions from the whistle. Most importantly, every forward and midfielder pushed up and put pressure on the opponent. On an uneven surface, the Lions were always on the back foot. It wasn't easy for City to play good football either, but City succeeded in passing the ball and keeping possession. The breakthrough came from a Tim free-kick flicked on by Dan and Sean in quick succession to Paco. The pressure continued, with the ball often in the Lions' box, although it took a special volley on the turn from Sean to put the scoreline at 2-0. There was no let up for the Lions this Sunday. The City defensive line marshalled by Tim was rock-solid, with particularly brilliant cover from Chris. Spencer in goal was authoritative when needed but that wasn't too often. John and Matt were rocks, too. Alex and Steve both defended and attacked well on the left and right, so vindicating the 3-5-2. Taipei scored a third goal before the break through Paco, or was it Dan?

Heedful of the wise words of Dan and John, those wise old owls, at half-time, City started the second half at the same high tempo they'd left off the first. Steve was a constant thorn in the Lions defence. Early on he won a free-kick in ideal Beckham territory. Tim ran over to confer on how best to convert it. Tim: "Just tap it to me here." Steve: "OK. Just here?" Tim: "Yeah, that's right. Let me just take a few steps back first. OK, now." (Steve tapped the ball a few inches. Tim looked at Steve.) Tim: "What's this?" Steve: "Sorry, you've touched it now, shall I take it?" Tim: "No, that's OK, I'll take it." (Tim now side-stepped two or three Lions before teeing up the ball to his satisfaction and steering it with his right. The ball flew like a plane at take-off, above the outstretched fingers of Rob, into the roof of the net.)

By now Matt was in goal an(?), Dan (or Paco) and Ricky when he came on. The Lions clawed back two goals mostly due to defensive mistakes from a clueless Christie in defence, but otherwise they had nothing. Taipei City walked off the pitch with heads held high knowing they'd done a good job.

Final score, Taipei City 7, Lions 2
