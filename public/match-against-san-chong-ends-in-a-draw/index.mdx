The first game of 2009 started rough with only 10 men on the pitch, but 3 minutes into the game Taipei City had a full squad.

The young San Chong team came out fast and scored 20 minutes into the game. Later in the first half Steve equalized with a clean put-away in the bottom corner, tying the game at 1-1.

City started the 2nd half strong with good defense from Chris and solid offensive advances from Alex R. It appeared the tide had turned for Taipei City with several close chances at goal in the last 15 minutes, but the matched expired in a draw.
