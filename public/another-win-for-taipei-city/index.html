      <p>Ah yes, the early BML kickoff. On one hand it makes it a bit difficult to plan wicked Saturday night festivities, yet on the other hand you&rsquo;ve got still got the rest of your Sunday to do with as you please.</p>
<p>Both teams looked short on players during warm up. After the lineup and friendly greeting, City only had 10 guys on the field when the kickoff whistle blew.</p>
<p>About 15 minutes later, with a full eleven on the pitch, things started to warm up for Taipei City offensively. Michael Christie took a nice half-volley from outside the 18-yard box to beat the keeper. 1-0 City.</p>
<p>Then we had some more goals, please forgive me if they&rsquo;re not in the right order.</p>
<p>Gustavo dribbled through the Jako defense for a tidy finish on the keeper, 2nd game scoring streak. 2-0 Tim cracked a well-placed shot past the keeper just on the edge of the 18-yard box. 3-0 Unlucky deflection as Taipei City scores its first own goal. 3-1 Michael Christie again with a diagonal wormburner from outside the 18 across the goal into the bottom left corner. 4-1 (2 goals from center-mid, nicely done!) Ross beats defender and keeper with a header from Spencer&rsquo;s cross. Final score 5-1.</p>
<p>It may sound like a one-sided game but Rojen made 3 spectacular one-on-one saves as substitute keeper&hellip;without which we would have easily been under heavy pressure from Jako.</p>
