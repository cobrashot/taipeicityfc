Earlier this season the San Chong High School team put up a good challenge to Taipei City, forcing a 1-1 tie.

City came out stronger this time, showing the quality of football that the fan(s) have come to expect from the BML champions.

Starting off with only 10 men on the field, City went down and scored even though the numbers were against them. Dan Calvert put away a nice goal early on, 1-0.

The young lads managed to sneak one past Taipei City moments later, putting the score even at 1-1. But then Dawda Fatty and Danny Weir each marked a goal, putting the score at 3-1 going into the half.

In the 2nd half, Calvert and Weir both scored again and Alex Ramirez put a well-placed ball past the San Chong keeper, final score 6-1 for Taipei City.
