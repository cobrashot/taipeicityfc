After a long Chinese New Year break, the boys in blue suffer a bad defeat to Fritz.

To quote Michael Christie's email:

"In possession, City gave the ball away too easily. Only Ebu was able to impose himself on the game going forward, otherwise the passing was either too predictable, in which case Fritz easily intercepted, or wayward. There was hardly any play, just negative possession at best and frantic punting it forward at worst.

Worse than this, there was little covering from midfield. For both the second and third Fritz goals they had a free man. Whether the tactics had anything to do with this is a moot point. The players on the field simply didn't have the energy or the tactical sense to track back when they should have. It made Fritz look much better than they really are.

The second half was not all glorious football from City. There could have been more width and both wide players were underused, but however that may be it was a massive improvement on the first half."

Sean did manage to score for Taipei City, a singular bright point to the day.
