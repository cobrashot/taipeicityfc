      <description>Time: 10am, November 7th, 2010 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park
By Michael Christie
There was a nice, slick surface, if a little wet and slippery in places, at Bai Ling for when Taipei City kicked off their BML campaign against JFC on Sunday morning at 9am. The slick surface meant that the ball skidded quickly over longer distances than usual, so everything was set up for a good game between two teams that like to pass.</description>

At least one of Taipei’s amateur soccer leagues will be decided tomorrow as Da-an face the Red Lions needing to win by at least three clear goals to snatch the Carnegies Premier League (CPL) title at 1pm at Taipei’s Dajia Riverside Park.
Across the city at Shilin’s Bai­ling Bridge at 4pm, expat team Taipei City can take a huge step toward clinching their second Businessman’s League (BML) trophy when they take on Sanchung High School.</description>

      <description>Time: 7pm, January 9th, 2010 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park
By Alice Davis and Michael Christie
With lashings of rain for a week beforehand, some doubted if the game would go ahead. But the skies cleared on Friday afternoon, so it was surprisingly warm and dry when the top two teams of the BML took to the field at 7pm on Saturday evening. The preparations were good by all the City players, Dan and Ross gave a serious team talk before the game which was just what everybody needed.</description>

Conditions: Wet
By Michael Christie
With an excellent squad assembled for the 2009/2010 BML season, the management team of Dan Calvert and Ross Conlon had a difficult job naming a starting eleven for the opening game. They decided on Dale Neal in goal, a three-man defence of Tim Murphy, Yunusa Njie and Matt Wharton, with Steven Raymond and Ross Conlon on the flanks.</description>

      <description>Ah yes, the early BML kickoff. On one hand it makes it a bit difficult to plan wicked Saturday night festivities, yet on the other hand you&amp;rsquo;ve got still got the rest of your Sunday to do with as you please.
Both teams looked short on players during warm up. After the lineup and friendly greeting, City only had 10 guys on the field when the kickoff whistle blew.
About 15 minutes later, with a full eleven on the pitch, things started to warm up for Taipei City offensively.</description>
