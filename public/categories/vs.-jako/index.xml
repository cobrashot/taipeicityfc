      <description>Ah yes, the early BML kickoff. On one hand it makes it a bit difficult to plan wicked Saturday night festivities, yet on the other hand you&amp;rsquo;ve got still got the rest of your Sunday to do with as you please.
Both teams looked short on players during warm up. After the lineup and friendly greeting, City only had 10 guys on the field when the kickoff whistle blew.
About 15 minutes later, with a full eleven on the pitch, things started to warm up for Taipei City offensively.</description>
