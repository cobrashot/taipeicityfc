<p>Just ahead of Taipei&rsquo;s first international sporting event, the Deaf Olympics; one of the Taipei&rsquo;s premier football clubs will face off against the reigning gold medallists in the games, Great Britain.  Although, the countries in the British Isles have been eluded by any kind of silverware since 1966 in World or European tournaments; in the Deaf Olympics they are champions.  Great Britain&rsquo;s Blind Olympic team has won in the games a total of six times and is the current champion.</p>

<p>Great Britain will start their campaign in the Deaf Olympics on Sept. 4th against Japan at the Yingfeng fields.  However, before this opening match they will face a tough practice match against Taipei City FC.  Taipei City FC were last years winners of the Taipei Businessman&rsquo;s League which plays regularly during the months from October to May on the Bailing Bridge field in Shilin.  The team has a completely international team with players from Gambia, United States, Canada, Mexico, Czech Republic, Jamaica, Ireland, England and many other countries.  The team has played both foreign and locally based teams and has proven it&rsquo;s ability which has earned it the opportunity to play against the Deaf Olympians.</p>
<p>Ross Conlon, captain of Taipei City says his team has been looking forward to the match and expects, &ldquo;a very tough challenge from the 6 time champs.  It will definately be a very interesting match and a good challenge&rdquo;  Confident that his team is well perepared for the match, his game plan is not to deviate too much from the succesful style of play that has brought them victories against local opponents. &quot; I don&rsquo;t think we will change too much, we just have to keep it tight for the first thirty and see how it goes.&quot;   This is not the first time that Taipei City FC has played a high level opponent as they play regular games against the Taiwanese National team.</p>
<p>The game will be played at the Taipei American School field in Tienmu with kick-off at 4:30pm on Saturday August 29th.</p>
