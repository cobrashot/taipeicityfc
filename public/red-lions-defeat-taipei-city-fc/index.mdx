In a repeat of last year's 1st leg of the BML, the Red Lions served up a healthy dish of revenge pie beating the reigning BML champions 2-1.

The boys in blue were up 1-0 at halftime but the Red Lions fought back hard in the 2nd half to score 2 goals and take home the win.

Taipei City did manage to score a goal, M. Christie in the 2nd half.
