      <p>Here are some rough ideas for the Canada Day Beach Soccer Tournament.</p>
<h2 id="field">Field</h2>
<p>These are the dimensions for a single field. <a href="http://taipeifc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/field1.png"><img src="http://taipeifc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/field1.png" alt="field1" title="field1"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://taipeifc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/field2.png"><img src="http://taipeifc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/field2.png" alt="field2" title="field2"></a></p>
<p>Most soccer rules revolve around a 10-meter rule. In beach soccer it is 5 meters.</p>
<p><a href="http://taipeifc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/field3.png"><img src="http://taipeifc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/field3.png" alt="field3" title="field3"></a></p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>These are the dimensions of a beach soccer goal. <a href="http://taipeifc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/goal1.png"><img src="http://taipeifc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/goal1.png" alt="goal1" title="goal1"></a> Here is a picture of a goal on the beach in Rio de Janeiro. <a href="http://taipeifc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/goal3.png"><img src="http://taipeifc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/goal3.png" alt="goal3" title="goal3"></a> The above goal is bit smaller than what we we would need. With a larger goal we should use a modified design so the crossbar doesn&rsquo;t hang down. Here is a more suitable design.  It would be portable enough to put in a van yet sturdy enough to support a 5-meter crossbar. <a href="http://taipeifc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/goal3.jpg"><img src="http://taipeifc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/goal3.jpg" alt="goal3" title="goal3"></a> I&rsquo;ve already been to the neighborhood hardware store to price out 3&quot; PVC piping and connectors.  As a rough estimate it would cost around 5,000-6,000 NT for a single goal. If there is enough room on the beach it would be a great tournament if we could have 2 fields/4 goals. With 2 fields we could invite 8 teams. 8 teams would mean around 70 players total.  And if you add up the additional friends and spectators the tournament would attract, it could bring a lot to the event. The refs can be arranged via the <a href="http://www.ctfa.com.tw/">CTFA</a> as they are quite accommodating and keen to promote soccer in Taiwan.  I will ask them if I can borrow corner flags from them on the day as well. Here&rsquo;s the official <a href="http://taipeifc.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/beachsoccer_lawsenglish.pdf">Beach Soccer Rules from FIFA.</a> [.pdf, 1.3 MB] I look forward to helping out however I can.  Let me know if you have any other ideas and hope to talk soon.
