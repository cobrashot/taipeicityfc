      <p>Time: 3pm, December 6th, 2009 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie On a warm and sunny day, Taipei City easily overcame the resistance offered by Dentway but only came away with five goals. The first clean sheet of the season was possibly more important than the margin of victory, if City can build on this performance. <a href="http://taipeifc.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/12-vs-rogue-dentway08.jpg"><img src="http://taipeifc.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/12-vs-rogue-dentway08.jpg" alt="" title="12-vs-rogue-dentway08"></a> The first half started with Alex Moga in goal; a back three of Matt Wharton, Tim Murphy and John Phillips; a five-man midfield of Spencer Pangborn and Stevey Reymond on the right and left flanks, and Oliver Harley, Michael Christie and Ebrima Njie in the middle; and, a forward pairing of Dawda Fatty and Dan Calvert. In the first ten minutes City were ragged but working hard to impose themselves on the game. Dentway were pushed back inside their own half. Thereafter, Dentway were determined in defence but lacked the confidence to attack with any conviction. Apart from their forwards, Dentway seemed happy to spend the game playing in their own half of the pitch. So, the first half fell into a familiar pattern of Taipei City keeping possession and sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly probing for openings. The passing was sometimes slow and sluggish from City but there was always a lot of space. The ball was played into feet quite often so with the class of the City forward pairing it was not long before City scored. Receiving the ball ten yards from the penalty box, Dawda turned, beat two men and weighted a perfect pass for Calvert to run on to and finish with aplomb. The second goal started with Oliver playing a one-two with Ebrima, receiving the return and surging into the opposition penalty box. He drew a number of defenders before sliding another perfectly weighted pass to Calvert, who this time from a tightening angle finished with force. <a href="http://taipeifc.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/12-vs-rogue-dentway09.jpg"><img src="http://taipeifc.files.wordpress.com/2009/12/12-vs-rogue-dentway09.jpg" alt="" title="12-vs-rogue-dentway09"></a> The second half started with Badou Njie on for Oliver. A little later, Nicklas Denser came on for Stevey, and later still Ramirez and Daly replaced Dawda and Matt. Moving and jumping for the ball, Spencer scored a superb header from a corner. Then, Dan&rsquo;s cross found Badou who volleyed the ball into the far corner of the net - a spectacular finish! It was in the second half that City enjoyed their best spell of football with Ebrima especially impressing. The passing was sharp and quick and there was more movement and zip in the build-up play. Near the end of the game, Dan claimed a fifth for City and a hat-trick for himself. In conclusion, this was not the hardest opposition, but on the day Taipei City did a good job.</p>
