Clear day, warm, little to no wind.

Alex R. scored in the first 5 minutes. Then Dawda scored 10 min later. And then again 10 minutes later. 3-0 halftime.

A few changes at the half with the guys coming over from the TPL to help out. Dawda put another one in the back of the net for a hard fought hat trick on the day. Shawn also scored 2 goals with one coming from a nice run through the defense inside the 6-yard box.

Final score 6-1 for the blue team.
