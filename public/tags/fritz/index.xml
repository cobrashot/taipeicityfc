      <description>Time: 3pm, May 27th, 2012 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie Were the celebrations following Taipei City’s draw against Bulien premature? Had Taipei City clinched the title or was it going to be taken away at the last? Following Fritz’s victory over the Red Lions on Thursday evening, Taipei City needed a draw or win to win the BML title outright on points in the last round of the 2011-12 season, against Fritz.</description>

      <description>Time: 5pm, March 25th, 2012 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie Two games of football in the space of twenty-four hours is a punishing schedule no matter what level of the game you play. If Fritz was going to get a result against Taipei City, this was a good opportunity. A few important players were missing, including Alex Ramirez and Omar Senoussi, as the Taipei City players gathered at Bai Ling on an exceptionally warm afternoon.</description>

      <description>Time: 5pm, March 13th, 2011 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie On a hot, dry Saturday afternoon, City gathered a squad of twelve to take on the once mighty Fritz. In previous seasons, facing Fritz with such a small squad would have been dicing with ignominious defeat, but Fritz are not what they were. (It seems like they&amp;rsquo;ve gone downhill a lot since last season, never mind from when they were at their peak.</description>

      <description>By Michael Christie After twelve games played, with ten victories, one draw and one defeat, Taipei City face into the penultimate game of the BML season in top spot. So, how has the season actually progressed for Taipei City so far…? Read on… Game 1: An Easy Opener against JFC Taipei City was lucky to have their easiest game of the season first. New to the BML, JFC strangely decided to field a weak team.</description>

      <description>By John Phillips Taipei Times Tuesday, Mar 30th, 2010 Taipei City FC wrapped up a successful Businessman’s League (BML) campaign with a narrow 2-1 victory over last season’s champions Fritz FC at Shilin’s Bailing Bridge on Sunday. With City having already made their second BML championship mathematically secure last week, both teams went into the season’s final game with little to play for but pride. The multinational expat side opened the scoring early in the first half with a fine solo effort from Alex Ramirez, the Mexican outpacing the Fritz defense to slide a neat finish past the ’keeper.</description>

      <description>Time: 10am, March 21st, 2010 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie On a warm morning, with a sandstorm blowing in from Mainland China, Taipei City faced Fritz Air in their penultimate game this season. Missing their influential contingent of Gambian students, City nevertheless assembled a strong eleven, albeit without regular goalkeeper, Dale (who turned up after the final whistle), obliging Spencer to put on the keeper&amp;rsquo;s jersey and gloves.</description>

      <title>Threadbare Blues have enough for Bulien</title>

      <description>Time: 10am, January 17th, 2010 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By John Phillips An understrength Taipei City side overcame a spirited performance by Bulien to maintain their challenge for a second BML crown. In the end the scoreline flattered Bulien who scored their second goal with the final kick of the game and never looked likely to upset a well-drilled City side. Missing regular starters Calvert, Ramirez, Christie, Conlon, the Njie trio and both goalkeepers through a mixture of injury, suspension and other commitments, City shuffled their pack but still had enough firepower to see off a Bulien team that worked hard but rarely threatened from open play.</description>

      <description>Time: 7pm, January 9th, 2010 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Alice Davis and Michael Christie With lashings of rain for a week beforehand, some doubted if the game would go ahead. But the skies cleared on Friday afternoon, so it was surprisingly warm and dry when the top two teams of the BML took to the field at 7pm on Saturday evening. The preparations were good by all the City players, Dan and Ross gave a serious team talk before the game which was just what everybody needed.</description>

      <description>Time: 1pm, December 13th, 2009 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie On an extremely hot day, with the sun beating down from a high place, Taipei City kicked off against San Chong. Ross had warned everybody before the game that San Chong had recently strung together some good results against the better sides in the league, so they would not be the pushovers remembered from previous seasons. He was right.</description>

      <description>Time: 3pm, December 6th, 2009 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie On a warm and sunny day, Taipei City easily overcame the resistance offered by Dentway but only came away with five goals. The first clean sheet of the season was possibly more important than the margin of victory, if City can build on this performance. The first half started with Alex Moga in goal; a back three of Matt Wharton, Tim Murphy and John Phillips; a five-man midfield of Spencer Pangborn and Stevey Reymond on the right and left flanks, and Oliver Harley, Michael Christie and Ebrima Njie in the middle; and, a forward pairing of Dawda Fatty and Dan Calvert.</description>

      <description>Time: 3pm, December 5th, 2009 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Alice Davis Was there the air of over-confidence amongst the Taipei City team on Saturday afternoon? Were the players expecting Rogue FC to succumb to their playful fancy tickles, roll over, and die? Only City’s players can answer that, but one thing was evident. Rogue ain’t no poodle. Baring row after row of jagged teeth, Rogue’s seemingly (and suprisingly?</description>

The midfield settled early and were able to thread quick balls all around the park. The midfield and forwards worked extremely hard to keep Fritz penned in deep.</description>

      <description>After a long Chinese New Year break, the boys in blue suffer a bad defeat to Fritz. To quote Michael Christie&amp;rsquo;s email: &amp;ldquo;In possession, City gave the ball away too easily. Only Ebu was able to impose himself on the game going forward, otherwise the passing was either too predictable, in which case Fritz easily intercepted, or wayward. There was hardly any play, just negative possession at best and frantic punting it forward at worst.</description>
