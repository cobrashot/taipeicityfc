      <description>Time: 3pm, January 31st, 2010 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Ed Cartee The win streak is still intact as Taipei City make a run for the BML title, despite City not being their usual selves on this day. The weather was decently hot, especially in contrast to the cooler temperatures in recent weeks, and many of City&amp;rsquo;s players weren&amp;rsquo;t totally fresh since they had already played a full game earlier in the day for their CPL teams.</description>
