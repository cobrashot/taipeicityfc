      <description>Time: 3pm, May 27th, 2012 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie Were the celebrations following Taipei City’s draw against Bulien premature? Had Taipei City clinched the title or was it going to be taken away at the last? Following Fritz’s victory over the Red Lions on Thursday evening, Taipei City needed a draw or win to win the BML title outright on points in the last round of the 2011-12 season, against Fritz.</description>

      <description>Time: 3pm, May 20th, 2012 Venue: BaiLing Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie A single point would be enough to claim a third BML Championship, but against Bulien anything might happen and what a day for a football match! On a waterlogged pitch fit only for crabs, ducks and other wildlife, Taipei City took on an old bete noire in an ugly-tempered game. The weather, pitch and the football were all equally ugly.</description>

      <description>Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie Two games in two days is not recommended for a footballer&amp;rsquo;s health or for his play, yet, with four games left to play and firmly seated in the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat with all eyes on the prize of the BML Title, that was what was required of Taipei City against the rookie boys of San Chung High School on Saturday, May 12th and against the redoubtable Red Lions on Sunday, May 13th.</description>

      <description>Time: 5pm, March 25th, 2012 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie Two games of football in the space of twenty-four hours is a punishing schedule no matter what level of the game you play. If Fritz was going to get a result against Taipei City, this was a good opportunity. A few important players were missing, including Alex Ramirez and Omar Senoussi, as the Taipei City players gathered at Bai Ling on an exceptionally warm afternoon.</description>

      <description>Time: 7pm, March 24th, 2012 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie In unseasonably cold weather, Taipei City took on Mitsukoshi in the first game of the weekend double-header. Rightly concentrating on the here and now, Dan Calvert asked his squad before kick-off to forget about Fritz the next day and just do their best to beat Mitsukoshi, a team capable of surprises. Dan named a 4-4-2 formation of Dale Neal in goal; Ricardo Abrego, Brian McGuinness, Tom Clarke and ‘Dapper’ Danny Wilkinson at the back; Danny Weir, Ebu Njie, debutant Michael Crossley and Omar Malcolm in midfield; and, Brian Fitzpatrick and Dan Calvert up front.</description>

      <description>Time: 7pm, March 17th, 2012 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie As usual against Hong Ming Bulien, Taipei City did not enjoy the best preparation in the critical hour leading up to the kick-off. Several players struggled to arrive in time, but Taipei City still had a good eleven ready to start, and of course an exceptionally strong bench. The 4-4-2 formation comprised Dale Neal in goal; a back line of Ricardo Abrego, Brian McGuinness, Tom Clarke and Mamadi Colley; a midfield quartet of Danny Weir, Oumar Senoussi, Michael Christie and Omar Malcolm; and a front pairing of Brian Fitzpatrick and Neo King.</description>

      <description>Time: 2pm, March 4th, 2012 Venue: Yingfeng Riverside Park By Michael Christie On a bright, hot day at Da Jia Yingfeng Riverside Park, the Taipei City players gathered in readiness for the match against the Taipei Peacocks – on their home turf. The surface was dry and smooth in spite of the damp weather since Chinese New Year. The wind affected the flight of the ball during the game! This was the first day of BML competition in March, and the fixtures are not yet half completed.</description>

      <description>Time: 10am, February 12th, 2012 Venue:BaiLing Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie Another hot weekend came around on the heels of a cold, grey week, and at 10am on Sunday morning the sun was shining bright for the long-awaited encounter between Taipei City and the Red Lions. Unlike in more temperate climes, if the sun is out in Taiwan it is already hot enough at 10am to stymie all but the fittest.</description>

      <description>Time: 3pm, January 15th, 2012 Venue:BaiLingBridgeRiversidePark By Michael Christie On a treacherous pitch inimical to the stylish kind of game Taipei City aspires to, the boys of San Chung Senior High were looking for an upset. In the end, though, while they showed clever footwork and some pace, they lacked strength. A solid if unspectacular performance from City was enough. Dan started with a back line of Dale Neal in goal, Matt Wharton at right-back, Brian McGuinness and Tom Clarke in central defense, and Oumar Yassouf at left-back.</description>

      <description>Time: 7pm, January 8th, 2012 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie Rescheduled to 7pm for arcane reasons unknown, the Bai Ling pitch had slightly longer to recover from the rain but it was still a wet, stodgy surface. Covered in sand, there were no puddles and it was not too slippery, but the bobbles made for some unpredictable bounces in a competitive match. Without Ross Conlon’s customary input – his focus and enthusiasm was missed – it was left to Dan Calvert to give the pre-match team talk.</description>

      <description>Time: 1pm, November 27th, 2011 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie On a smooth, dry Taiwanese riverside surface, two tough expat teams faced each other in the season opener.TaipeiCitywas the favorite to win, but Rogue had a new team and was looking for an upset. Wily manager Ross Conlon opted for a 4-4-1-1 formation to start. As usual, Dale was in goal. The back four, from right-back stretching to left-back, was Ricardo Abrego, Tom Clarke, Karim Cham and “Dapper” Daniel Wilkinson.</description>

      <description>Time: 6pm, March 19th, 2011 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie With everything to play for, both Taipei City and Hong Ming Bualien lined up to contest the game of the season – the BML final in all but name. Taipei City started with a 4-4-2 formation: Dale Neal in goal, Yunusa Njie at right-back, Ross Conlon at left-back, Brian McGuinness and Tom Clarke in central defense, Carlos Mayorga at right-midfield, Alex Ramirez at left-midfield, Ebrima Njie and Badou Njie in central midfield, and Dawda Fatty and Dan Calvert up front, Dawda in the hole and Dan as the target man.</description>

      <description>Time: 5pm, March 13th, 2011 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie On a hot, dry Saturday afternoon, City gathered a squad of twelve to take on the once mighty Fritz. In previous seasons, facing Fritz with such a small squad would have been dicing with ignominious defeat, but Fritz are not what they were. (It seems like they&amp;rsquo;ve gone downhill a lot since last season, never mind from when they were at their peak.</description>

So, how has the season actually progressed for Taipei City so far…? Read on… Game 1: An Easy Opener against JFC Taipei City was lucky to have their easiest game of the season first. New to the BML, JFC strangely decided to field a weak team.</description>

      <description>Time: 10am, November 7th, 2010 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie There was a nice, slick surface, if a little wet and slippery in places, at Bai Ling for when Taipei City kicked off their BML campaign against JFC on Sunday morning at 9am. The slick surface meant that the ball skidded quickly over longer distances than usual, so everything was set up for a good game between two teams that like to pass.</description>

      <description>By John Phillips Taipei Times Tuesday, Mar 30th, 2010 Taipei City FC wrapped up a successful Businessman’s League (BML) campaign with a narrow 2-1 victory over last season’s champions Fritz FC at Shilin’s Bailing Bridge on Sunday. With City having already made their second BML championship mathematically secure last week, both teams went into the season’s final game with little to play for but pride. The multinational expat side opened the scoring early in the first half with a fine solo effort from Alex Ramirez, the Mexican outpacing the Fritz defense to slide a neat finish past the ’keeper.</description>

      <description>Time: 10am, March 21st, 2010 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie On a warm morning, with a sandstorm blowing in from Mainland China, Taipei City faced Fritz Air in their penultimate game this season. Missing their influential contingent of Gambian students, City nevertheless assembled a strong eleven, albeit without regular goalkeeper, Dale (who turned up after the final whistle), obliging Spencer to put on the keeper&amp;rsquo;s jersey and gloves.</description>

      <description>Time: 1pm, March 14th, 2010 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Ed Cartee With 3 games left in the season, City knew that 2 wins would clinch the BML title; but the way to that goal lay first through the San Chong boys, one of the more impressive possession-oriented sides in the rest of the league, so City had to be fully focused and honed in on the 90 minutes before them.</description>

      <description>By John Phillips Taipei Times Saturday, Mar 13, 2010 At least one of Taipei’s amateur soccer leagues will be decided tomorrow as Da-an face the Red Lions needing to win by at least three clear goals to snatch the Carnegies Premier League (CPL) title at 1pm at Taipei’s Dajia Riverside Park. Across the city at Shilin’s Bai­ling Bridge at 4pm, expat team Taipei City can take a huge step toward clinching their second Businessman’s League (BML) trophy when they take on Sanchung High School.</description>

      <description>Time: 5.30pm, February 8th, 2010 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie Agreeing to put the start of the match back to 5.30, the match referee wasn&amp;rsquo;t very sympathetic to the eight City players kitted up at 5.25 when asked to delay it further. Still, within seconds of a 4-3-0 formation taking the field, Dawda, Tim, Mamadi, Ebou and Yunusa arrived. Niklas also showed up, but he&amp;rsquo;d lost the keys to his rooms so he didn&amp;rsquo;t have a kit and had to watch from the sidelines.</description>

      <description>Time: 3pm, January 31st, 2010 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Ed Cartee The win streak is still intact as Taipei City make a run for the BML title, despite City not being their usual selves on this day. The weather was decently hot, especially in contrast to the cooler temperatures in recent weeks, and many of City&amp;rsquo;s players weren&amp;rsquo;t totally fresh since they had already played a full game earlier in the day for their CPL teams.</description>

      <description>Time: 1pm, January 24th, 2010 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie The last time City and Rogue met, in November, produced an upset and the only loss City have suffered this season. The Rogue were without Canadian Andy, scorer of a spectacular goal in the earlier game, but still assembled a good, determined side. For their part, the Taipei City management team of Ross and Dan urged every every player to maximize their effort levels, and only then would football skill and know-how decide the result.</description>

      <description>Time: 10am, January 17th, 2010 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By John Phillips An understrength Taipei City side overcame a spirited performance by Bulien to maintain their challenge for a second BML crown. In the end the scoreline flattered Bulien who scored their second goal with the final kick of the game and never looked likely to upset a well-drilled City side. Missing regular starters Calvert, Ramirez, Christie, Conlon, the Njie trio and both goalkeepers through a mixture of injury, suspension and other commitments, City shuffled their pack but still had enough firepower to see off a Bulien team that worked hard but rarely threatened from open play.</description>

But the skies cleared on Friday afternoon, so it was surprisingly warm and dry when the top two teams of the BML took to the field at 7pm on Saturday evening. The preparations were good by all the City players, Dan and Ross gave a serious team talk before the game which was just what everybody needed.</description>

      <description>On a cold morning,Taipei City engaged with a depleted Fritz Air team. The kick-off was put back thirty minutes to allow enough Fritz Air players to get out of bed. This was frustrating for City given that everybody had assembled right on time. Dawda led an excellent warm-up at 9.45, but the game started at about 10.30. When the game finally started, City fielded an exceptionally strong eleven against a team of eight.</description>

      <description>Time: 1pm, December 13th, 2009 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie On an extremely hot day, with the sun beating down from a high place, Taipei City kicked off against San Chong. Ross had warned everybody before the game that San Chong had recently strung together some good results against the better sides in the league, so they would not be the pushovers remembered from previous seasons. He was right.</description>

      <description>Time: 3pm, December 6th, 2009 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie On a warm and sunny day, Taipei City easily overcame the resistance offered by Dentway but only came away with five goals. The first clean sheet of the season was possibly more important than the margin of victory, if City can build on this performance. The first half started with Alex Moga in goal; a back three of Matt Wharton, Tim Murphy and John Phillips; a five-man midfield of Spencer Pangborn and Stevey Reymond on the right and left flanks, and Oliver Harley, Michael Christie and Ebrima Njie in the middle; and, a forward pairing of Dawda Fatty and Dan Calvert.</description>

      <description>Time: 3pm, December 5th, 2009 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Alice Davis Was there the air of over-confidence amongst the Taipei City team on Saturday afternoon? Were the players expecting Rogue FC to succumb to their playful fancy tickles, roll over, and die? Only City’s players can answer that, but one thing was evident. Rogue ain’t no poodle. Baring row after row of jagged teeth, Rogue’s seemingly (and suprisingly?</description>

      <description>Taipei City took six of a possible six points over the weekend with two wins in well-contested battles. Saturday saw the team face an old enemy, The Red Lions. The Lions, reinvigorated by the offseason’s most controversial signing Onur Dogan, looked lively up front and gave the City defence plenty to think about. The Turk scored two goals on the night, the second a fine finish on the turn and volley.</description>

      <description>Time: 7.30pm, November 11, 2009 Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park A cagey affair saw City edge out a resilient Shin Kong Mitsukoshi side 2-1 last Wednesday evening. In an unprecedented turn of events, the City boys had the referee to thank when they were awarded a very dubious penalty midway through the second half, at a time when neither team had yet managed to score. Mitsukoshi’s central defender was adjudged to have tugged at Dan Calvert’s jersey as he tried to get on the end of a cross from the right wing.</description>

      <description>by Michael Christie Venue: Ming Chuan University Campus, Tao Yuan Time: Sat Sept 5th, 4.30pm Conditions: Dry and hot Here was a game with lots of chances at both ends and generally good performances from both teams. On a dry, uneven pitch, Ming Chuan University arguably started better with their triangular passing causing problems down both flanks early on. It was from this kind of attack that they opened the scoring.</description>

      <description>By Dave Carroll Taipei Times Sunday, Aug 30, 2009 The British Deaflympic men’s soccer team beat Businessman’s League champions Taipei City FC 3-0 in a warmup match in Tianmu yesterday. A 4:30pm kick off on a pitch half covered in shadow with a gentle breeze blowing were about as ideal conditions as the teams could have wished for considering the recent heat.

Just ahead of Taipei&amp;rsquo;s first international sporting event, the Deaf Olympics; one of the Taipei&amp;rsquo;s premier football clubs will face off against the reigning gold medallists in the games, Great Britain. Although, the countries in the British Isles have been eluded by any kind of silverware since 1966 in World or European tournaments; in the Deaf Olympics they are champions. Great Britain&amp;rsquo;s Blind Olympic team has won in the games a total of six times and is the current champion.</description>

The midfield settled early and were able to thread quick balls all around the park. The midfield and forwards worked extremely hard to keep Fritz penned in deep.</description>

The last time Taipei City played Mitsukoshi the score was 6-2. It was the same this time. In the hot midday sun, City put together a good performance against uninspired opposition. Though not without talent in some positions, it seemed like Mitsukoshi were firmly put in their place after just a few minutes.</description>

      <description>Earlier this season the San Chong High School team put up a good challenge to Taipei City, forcing a 1-1 tie. City came out stronger this time, showing the quality of football that the fan(s) have come to expect from the BML champions. Starting off with only 10 men on the field, City went down and scored even though the numbers were against them. Dan Calvert put away a nice goal early on, 1-0.</description>

      <description>On a surprisingly cloudy day, Taipei City assembled a surprisingly small squad to give Fritz Air a surprisingly good game. Played on Bai Ling B, the surface was uneven in places but still allowed for good football. With several defensive specialists missing, the Taipei City starting line-up looked attack top-heavy. The biggest shock saw Dan Calvert play as the sweeper. (Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s Dan Calvert playing as the sweeper!) With the ever-reliable Sam in goal and John and Christie either side, the defence was by no means weak.</description>

      <description>Match Report by Michael Christie Location: Bai Ling B (the crappy pitch) Conditions: Fair to firm Referee: Wearing sunglasses before the game Report: Starting in a 3-5-2 formation, Taipei City took the game to the Red Lions from the whistle. Most importantly, every forward and midfielder pushed up and put pressure on the opponent. On an uneven surface, the Lions were always on the back foot. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy for City to play good football either, but City succeeded in passing the ball and keeping possession.</description>

Moments later another goal was in the back of the net, again from Steve crossing to Mr. Calvert again, 2-0. Later in the half Matt Swift from Rogue scored an own goal, 3-0.</description>

      <description>After a long Chinese New Year break, the boys in blue suffer a bad defeat to Fritz. To quote Michael Christie&amp;rsquo;s email: &amp;ldquo;In possession, City gave the ball away too easily. Only Ebu was able to impose himself on the game going forward, otherwise the passing was either too predictable, in which case Fritz easily intercepted, or wayward. There was hardly any play, just negative possession at best and frantic punting it forward at worst.</description>

A few changes at the half with the guys coming over from the TPL to help out. Dawda put another one in the back of the net for a hard fought hat trick on the day. Shawn also scored 2 goals with one coming from a nice run through the defense inside the 6-yard box.</description>

The young San Chong team came out fast and scored 20 minutes into the game. Later in the first half Steve equalized with a clean put-away in the bottom corner, tying the game at 1-1. City started the 2nd half strong with good defense from Chris and solid offensive advances from Alex R.</description>

      <description>Ah yes, the early BML kickoff. On one hand it makes it a bit difficult to plan wicked Saturday night festivities, yet on the other hand you&amp;rsquo;ve got still got the rest of your Sunday to do with as you please. Both teams looked short on players during warm up. After the lineup and friendly greeting, City only had 10 guys on the field when the kickoff whistle blew. About 15 minutes later, with a full eleven on the pitch, things started to warm up for Taipei City offensively.</description>

Chinese Taipei showed their impressive speed and endurance against Taipei City FC. They were fast with their passes and physically fit.</description>

      <description>After a slow start to the season, at one point resting 6th out of 8 teams, Taipei City FC has clawed its way back to the top of the BML standings. This past weekend Taipei City posted wins over Jako FC and SanChong High School. These 2 victories helped extend City&amp;rsquo;s current winning streak to 8 games. Here is the match report by team captain Dan Calvert. Here are a few pics from Saturday&amp;rsquo;s match.</description>

      <description>Taipei City&amp;rsquo;s 6th consecutive victory, a 5-0 beating of the Red Lions, came as no surprise as the team has played steady throughout the year. The score came in quite handy, because Taipei City are now sitting on top of the league table, just ahead of Fritz on goal difference. </description>
