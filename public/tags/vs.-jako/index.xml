      <description>A thorough dusting of Jako on a wet Wednesday night. Here were the goals: Sean Dan Alex R. Alex R. - 4-0 halftime - Dawda Alex R. Dawda Tim Tim Alex R. - 10-0 final - Congrats to Alex Ramirez for scoring 4 goals in a single game&amp;hellip;a hat-and-a-half trick or something like that. Close to something like this: On 3 December 2008 Carlos Tevez of Manchester United scored a &amp;lsquo;grand slam&amp;rsquo; against Blackburn Rovers.</description>

Both teams looked short on players during warm up. After the lineup and friendly greeting, City only had 10 guys on the field when the kickoff whistle blew. About 15 minutes later, with a full eleven on the pitch, things started to warm up for Taipei City offensively.</description>
