      <p>Venue: Bai Ling Bridge Riverside Park By Michael Christie Two games in two days is not recommended for a footballer&rsquo;s health or for his play, yet, with four games left to play and firmly seated in the driver&rsquo;s seat with all eyes on the prize of the BML Title, that was what was required of Taipei City against the rookie boys of San Chung High School on Saturday, May 12th and against the redoubtable Red Lions on Sunday, May 13th. <strong>Saturday&rsquo;s Kids Test City– Raw</strong> The teenagers of San Chung are maturing all the time and proved it by givingTaipeiCity a stiff test. For seventy minutes San Chung held City to 1-1. Indeed, the boys passed the ball effectively and made City run hard. The game seemed to be heading for a draw until, with twenty minutes to go, substitute Luis Mayorga came on and immediately stamped his presence on the game. With his trademark mixture of guile and speed he snaffled his first goal on eighty minutes and then decided one was not enough so scored again to make the final score a flattering 3-1 to City. <a href="http://taipeifc.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/p5138781web.jpg"><img src="http://taipeifc.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/p5138781web.jpg" alt="" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA"></a> <strong>Sunday&rsquo;s Lions Test City– Roar</strong> The Lions had a few of their players unavailable but still came to win the game - if they could. The first half was a leaden display from both teams, with neither team really deserving to score. However, after some sloppy play in the middle of the park from City, the Lions fed the ball to their right winger. He attempted a cross but got a lucky slice and the ball looped over the stranded Dale into the net. City pulled one back later through Neo King. It was 1-1 at the break. <a href="http://taipeifc.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/p5138765web.jpg"><img src="http://taipeifc.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/p5138765web.jpg" alt="" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA"></a> The second half started off as drearily as the first, but with half an hour gone Oscar Auguilera came on to make his long awaited debut for City - what a difference he made! His first touch and incisive running was enough to create several chances for his team-mates. City looked like a good team again. Through a combination of wasteful finishing and good keeping from the Lions&rsquo; Volker, however, City couldn&rsquo;t score. With only five minutes left on the clock, though, Oscar fed Neo through the middle and with that finish parried by the keeper and rolling into touch for a corner, Oscar showed magical pace to slide - a two-second, three-yard slide - and jab the ball into the net from the tightest of angles. 2-1 to City! <a href="http://taipeifc.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/p5138779web.jpg"><img src="http://taipeifc.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/p5138779web.jpg" alt="" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA"></a></p>
