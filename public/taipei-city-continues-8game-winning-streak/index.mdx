After a slow start to the season, at one point resting 6th out of 8 teams, Taipei City FC has clawed its way back to the top of the BML standings.

This past weekend Taipei City posted wins over Jako FC and SanChong High School. These 2 victories helped extend City's current winning streak to 8 games.
