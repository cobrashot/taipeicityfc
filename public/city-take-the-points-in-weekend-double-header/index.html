      <p>Taipei City took six of a possible six points over the weekend with two wins in well-contested battles. Saturday saw the team face an old enemy, The Red Lions. The Lions, reinvigorated by the offseason’s most controversial signing Onur Dogan, looked lively up front and gave the City defence plenty to think about. The Turk scored two goals on the night, the second a fine finish on the turn and volley. However, his efforts alone weren’t enough to give this City side too much trouble, and they always managed to keep their noses in front of an otherwise ageing Lions’ side, running out eventual winners with a 4-2 scoreline with goals from Tim Murphy,  Alex Ramirez, Niklas Denser and Ebrima Njie. <a href="http://taipeifc.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/11-vs-southeasterly-1.jpg"><img src="http://taipeifc.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/11-vs-southeasterly-1.jpg" alt="" title="11-vs-southeasterly-1"></a> Sunday’s game was a much cagier affair with Southeasterly content to sit back and try to catch Taipei City on the break. This tactic nullified City’s pace, and they were restricted to trying to thread short passes between Southeasterly’s tightly-meshed defensive unit. City failed to adjust their game sufficiently, and their final ball let them down time and time again. In the end, Southeasterly’s negativity became their own undoing as City eventually managed to put a couple of goals from Michael Christie and Danny Weir past the tiring opposition. With the score at 2-0, Southeasterly pulled a goal back, scoring from a penalty awarded for a dive in the box so obvious that even their players could see the funny side of it. <a href="http://taipeifc.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/11-vs-southeasterly-2.jpg"><img src="http://taipeifc.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/11-vs-southeasterly-2.jpg" alt="" title="11-vs-southeasterly-2"></a> City added a third with the formidable Dan Calvert making  sure of the win and securing the six points they set out for over the weekend. Final score 3-1. The game was also a final farewell to Danny who was glad to get one final goal before he’s return to his native England, he’s exploits on both wings will be thoroughly missed.</p>
