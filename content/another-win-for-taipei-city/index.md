Ah yes, the early BML kickoff. On one hand it makes it a bit difficult to plan wicked Saturday night festivities, yet on the other hand you've got still got the rest of your Sunday to do with as you please.

Both teams looked short on players during warm up. After the lineup and friendly greeting, City only had 10 guys on the field when the kickoff whistle blew.

About 15 minutes later, with a full eleven on the pitch, things started to warm up for Taipei City offensively. Michael Christie took a nice half-volley from outside the 18-yard box to beat the keeper. 1-0 City.

Then we had some more goals, please forgive me if they're not in the right order.

Gustavo dribbled through the Jako defense for a tidy finish on the keeper, 2nd game scoring streak. 2-0 Tim cracked a well-placed shot past the keeper just on the edge of the 18-yard box. 3-0 Unlucky deflection as Taipei City scores its first own goal. 3-1 Michael Christie again with a diagonal wormburner from outside the 18 across the goal into the bottom left corner. 4-1 (2 goals from center-mid, nicely done!) Ross beats defender and keeper with a header from Spencer's cross. Final score 5-1.

It may sound like a one-sided game but Rojen made 3 spectacular one-on-one saves as substitute keeper...without which we would have easily been under heavy pressure from Jako.
